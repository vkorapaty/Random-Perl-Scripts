Games downloaded from GOG are placed in 'Documents\GOG.com Downloads' by default. The files downloaded are placed in folders, where each folder is the name of the respective game. For example, the soundtrack for fallout is placed in 'Documents\GOG.com Downloads\fallout'. The script is located in 'Documents', starts out accessing 'Documents\GOG.com Downloads' and creating a list of game directories (or non-directories really, the directories I'm looking for aren't considered directories by the grep function or something). After that list is made, the script goes through each of those directories, looking for files with 'soundtrack' or 'ost' in their name. The full path for the soundtrack file found is then obtained, and a copy of the file is made to the backup directory defined at the top of the script.
